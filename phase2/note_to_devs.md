# Important Note
- In "phase2>tools>tools.py" file, there is a tool named "detect_outliers". In that tool, only one way of detecting outlier has been specified due to lack of knowledge in the field of real estate. One can easily edit that out, or come up with other tools for outlier detection in tools.py file. After that the data intelligent system can detect outliers more clearly and overall accuracy of the system can be enhanced.
- Some of the suggested ways of determinig outliers can be:
1. Z-Score Method (Standardized Normal)
2. IQR Method (Interquartile Range)
3. Domain Knowledge Filters (Real Estate Specific)
4. Unsupervised ML Methods
5. Geospatial Outlier Detection

- A simple rule based technique is being used in the given code base.
